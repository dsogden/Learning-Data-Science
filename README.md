# Learning-Data-Science

With this repository, I am learning to improve my python programming skills, learn some data science tricks, and really have some fun digging into a project that isn't for my research. 

This project will utlize some molecular dynamics simulation data on a dialanine peptide. Each simulation run is done so using NAMD 2.13, parameterized with the CHARMM36 forcefield, at 310K, in TIP3P water, and ionized with NaCl. The production runs will be for 3ns each and run in replicate 3 times.
