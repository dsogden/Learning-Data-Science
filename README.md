# Learning-Data-Science

With this repository, I am learning to improve my python programming skills, learn some data science tricks, and really have some fun digging into a project that isn't for my research. 

This project will utlize some molecular dynamics simulation data on a alanine-phenylalanine peptide. Each simulation run is done so using NAMD 2.13, parameterized with the CHARMM36 forcefield, at 310K, in TIP3P water, and ionized with NaCl. The production runs will be for 10ns each and run in replicate 3 times. I will first analyze initially the data using VMD to learn some biologically relevant information, and then use some python libraries to let me learn some more patterns in the initial data. I will then split the data into training and testing sets and see what machine learning we can do with the data. 

This is my first personal project and has been a pleasure putting everything together.
